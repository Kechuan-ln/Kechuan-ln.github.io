####  Introduction

- I am a Master's student at the University of Tokyo. I work at the intersection of artificial intelligence, geospatial analysis, and urban energy systems. My research focuses on spatiotemporal deep learning for large-scale solar potential estimation and the optimization of 3D human pose estimation for prosthesis users through multi-source data fusion. I am particularly interested in collaborative projects that integrate interpretable and physics-informed AI with real-world sustainability and healthcare challenges. I am seeking short-term research visits to enhance my methodological expertise and broaden interdisciplinary collaboration, with a long-term goal of pursuing a Ph.D. in a related field.
